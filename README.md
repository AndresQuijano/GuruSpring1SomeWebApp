# GuruSpring1SomeWebApp
First web app created using Spring 5 from Guru course on Udemy.

It's a library web app that shows a list of books under /books and a list of authors under /authors. Implements the MVC design pattern and utilizes a H2 in memory database. There's also a brief use of Thymeleaf on the view.
